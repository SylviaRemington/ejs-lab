# EJS Lab

In this lab, I’ll be constructing a dynamic website for a fictional restaurant, “The Green Byte Bistro.” This hands-on experience is designed to solidify my understanding of using EJS templates with an Express.js application.

## What I’ll Build
I'm going to create a vibrant, interactive website for The Green Byte Bistro. 
This website will feature:

### Homepage:
Displaying key details of the bistro - name, address, and contact info.

### Nav Bar:
Including links to various sections of the site.

### Menu Page:
Showcasing the menu, sorted into mains, desserts, and sides.

### Category Page:
Generating pages for each menu type, using route parameters for content rendering.
