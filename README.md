# EJS Lab

In this lab, I’ll be constructing a dynamic website for a fictional restaurant, “The Green Byte Bistro.” This hands-on experience is designed to solidify my understanding of using EJS templates with an Express.js application.

## What I’ll Build
Per assignment verbiage, it states that I will create a vibrant, interactive website for The Green Byte Bistro. In following the mvp of the lab, the website doesn't currently seem to be vibrant; however, that can be changed with further styling in the future.

## This website will feature the following:

### Homepage
Displaying key details of the bistro - name, address, and contact info.

### Nav Bar
Including links to various sections of the site.

### Full Menu Page
Showcasing the menu, sorted into mains, desserts, and sides.

### Category Page - including Main Dishes, Desserts, & Sides
Generating pages for each menu type, using route parameters for content rendering.
